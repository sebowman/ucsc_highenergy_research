# ucsc_highenergy_research

This repository contains samples of the work I did with Dr. David Smith's high energy particle physics research group at the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics, University of California, Santa Cruz.  Included are PDF energy spectrum plots I created with ggplot2 in Rstudio, a Jupyter notebook in which I performed data analysis and visualization for particle detector calibration, and a Python script I wrote for merging the large particle detector data log files, designed for use on a UNIX system.
